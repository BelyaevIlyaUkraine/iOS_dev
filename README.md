# iOS development

# Apps for iOS that I've already created during studying iOS dev:

# 1)Checklists 1.0
App for handling lists of different deals that you are going to complete in future.App allows you to add,delete,edit checklists and items in them.They can also be configurated(for checklists-name and icon,for items-name and reminding in definite timestamp).If app is not launched,you will get local notification about deal in set timestamp.

This app version is simple enough and minimalistic with not so big functionality but perspectively improved version with new cool features will be released by me in future during further studying
